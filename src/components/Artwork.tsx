                            <p>I drew, created, and edited animated film showcasing a fictional chef's daily life. I worked on the piece extensively over the course of two months.</p>

                            <p>For a final project, I tried oil painting for the first time. It resulted in this 3ft by 3ft canvas, <i>Pebbles & Piers</i>, which is a portrayal of Brighton beach in my English hometown.</p>

                            <p>I honed wheel throwing for five months, crafting functional pottery. The art of creating delicate, lightweight pieces resonated with me, furthering my appreciation for this craft.</p>

                            <p>After making some digital art in graphic design and manual animations, I wanted to blend the two. I learned the ropes of the powerful software <i>Blender</i>, and created this doughnut clip.</p>
