                        <p>I created a meticulously designed an animated film that captures a couple days of a fictional chef. I used a camera to capture each frame of the animation. I hand drew each image and cut them out, before meticulously arranging these cutouts to portray the given scene. This project required a dedicated and consistent two-month effort to bring to completion.</p>
